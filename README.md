# BORIS BIKES by Alec and Jack | Makers Week 1 - Thurday Pairing session

Create a program that creates a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can do.

## Build Status

This program is a fork of crotcheycrows repo where challenges 1 through 9 (almost) were completed.

Update (end Wednesday): Max and I got to end of challenge 13.

To do: Thursday - Alec and Jack pair programming on this from challenge 14 onwards



## CHALLENGES COMPLETED

- [x] Start irb (or any other REPL) from the Command Line
- [x] Set a variable docking_station equal to a new DockingStation object
- [x] Explain to your pair partner what the resulting error means.
  - error message essentially said that the constant did not exist and could not be found in the ruby language, the irb or any gems.

DONE#

4. Errors are good
- [x] Write down the type of error
  - uninitalized constant

- [x] Set up the spec file to describe a DockingStation
- [x] Run RSpec from the Command Line
- [x] Explain to your pair partner the difference between this error and the error you saw before.
  - No method created to release the bike

DONE#

6. Passing your first Unit Test

- [x] Define a DockingStation class
- [x] Use require to include this file inside your spec file
- [x] Run RSpec from the Command Line
- [x] Explain to your pair partner the difference between what you see, and the error you saw before.

DONE#

7. Back to the feature

- [x] Start irb (or any other REPL) from the Command Line
- [x] Use require to include the file that contains the DockingStation class definition
- [x] Set a variable docking_station equal to a new DockingStation object
- [x] Explain to your pair partner why you do not see an error now, when you did before
- [x] Ask the docking_station instance to release_bike
- [x] Explain to your pair partner what the resulting error means.

DONE#

8. Back to the Unit

- [x] Add a test to your spec file that expects DockingStation instances to respond_to the method release_bike
- [x] Rewrite this test using RSpec's one-liner syntax
- [x] Run RSpec from the Command Line
- [x] Explain the error to your pair partner
    - *no method release_bike, so cannot find it*
- [x] Add a method release_bike to the DockingStation class
- [x] Run RSpec from the Command Line
- [x] Explain to your pair partner the difference between what you see, and the error you saw before.
  - we now have a method so it finds it and can run the test

DONE#

9. Building a bike
- [x] Start irb (or another REPL such as ðŸ’Š Pry)
- [x] Instantiate a DockingStation as docking_station
- [x] Ask docking_station to release a bike, and save the response to a variable bike
    - *Max fixed - changed docking station to create a new bike object.*
- [x] Ask the bike if it is working?
- [x] Explain the error to your pair partner
  - *unable to find method .working?, no Bike class*
- [x] Create a new spec file for a Bike class
- [x] Set up the spec file to describe the Bike class
- [x] Run RSpec from the Command Line
- [x] Fix the error you see, similarly to how you fixed the same error for DockingStation
- [x] Add a test to your bike_spec.rb file that expects Bike instances to respond_to the method working?
- [x] Make this test pass.

DONE#

10. Making Docking Stations Release Bikes
- [x]  Feature-test the feature you are building using irb
- [x]  Explain the error to your pair partner
- [x]  Add a test to your DockingStation specification that a) gets a bike, and then b) expects the bike to be working
- [x]  Make this test pass
- [x]  Feature-test the feature again.

DONE#

11.  Using Instance Variables

- [x] Write a feature test for docking a bike at a docking station
- [x] Write a unit test for the method you need to
  add to DockingStation to make docking possible
  - *When unit test run, .doc_bike return the bike id to us*
- [x] Pass both tests
- [x] Use an instance variable with attr_reader to do
  a full test-implementation cycle for the second User Story above
    - *added tests which docked a bike, checked bike was included in the bikes array, and inspected the bikes array*

As a member of the public
So I can return bikes I've hired
I want to dock my bike at the docking station

objects ------- messages

user            
bike             is_returned?
dockings station docks.bike

As a member of the public
So I can decide whether to use the docking station
I want to see a bike that has been docked

objects -------- messages

user
docking station  List.bikes
docking_station.List specific_bike

DONE#

12. Raising Exceptions

- [x] Feature test the feature you are building using irb
- [x] Use {} and raise_error syntax in your RSpec unit test to
  test exception raising
- [x] Use the fail or raise keyword to raise an exception in your
  code (not your tests)
- [x] Make the test pass by raising an exception
- [x] Explain why you use curly braces in the RSpec error handling
  syntax to your partner
- [x] Feature-test the feature again.

As a member of the public,
So that I am not confused and charged unnecessarily,
I'd like docking stations not to release bikes when there are none available.

Object ------------------ Message

User
docking_station.bike       true?     OR     false
docking)station            release_bike?    error

DONE#

13. Limiting Capacity

- [x] Deliver the feature above in a Test-Driven manner

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can control the distribution of bikes,
I'd like docking stations not to accept more bikes than their capacity.

objects ---------------- Message
Maintainer
docking_station.bike == 1
docking_station.dock_bike fail

Write RSpec tests that expect errors
Use fail or raise to raise an error
Use a 'guard condition'

DONE#

14. Wrapping Collections

- [x] Write a manual feature test for the above feature. Consider using 20.times { docking_station.dock Bike.new }.
- [x] Rename your attribute @bike to a name better reflecting that it will store more than one Bike instance.
- [x] Use rspec to identify areas of your code that need to be updated to use this new attribute name.
- [x] Update your existing tests to recognise this new name for the attribute.
- [x] Use an initialize function to set the initial value of this attribute to a simple collection object: an empty array.
- [x] Update your release_bike and dock methods to work with this new array (i.e. make your tests pass).
- [x] Update your release_bike and dock guard conditions to account for the new capacity of 20 bikes.


Wrap a collection in a class
Set an initial attribute value using initialize

As a system maintainer,
So that I can plan the distribution of bikes,
I want a docking station to have a default capacity of 20 bikes.

DONE#

15. The Single Responsibility Principle

- [x] Define a full? predicate method that uses some of the dock code to return true or false depending on whether the station is full or not
- [x]  Rewrite the guard condition of your dock method to incorporate your new full? method
- [x]  Do the same for release_bike, using an empty? method
- [x]  Use the private keyword to ensure these methods cannot be called from 'outside' instances of the DockingStation class.

Use the Single Responsibility Principle
Refactor code for readability

DONE#

16. Removing 'magic numbers'

### Learning Objectives covered
- Use a constant

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [x] Define a constant, `DEFAULT_CAPACITY`, that stores the number `20`. Do this within the `DockingStation` class.
- [x] Remove references to the magic number `20` in your implementation, using `DEFAULT_CAPACITY` instead.
- [x] Refactor your tests to use this new constant instead of the magic number `20`.

17. Initialisation defaults

### Learning Objectives covered
- Set an initial attribute value using `initialize`
- Set a default initialisation value

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [x] Write a feature test that allows a user to set a `@capacity` instance variable when `DockingStation.new` is called.
- [x] Create Unit tests for this
- [x] Implement the functionality in your code.
- [x] Write a feature test that ensures a default capacity of `20` is set when no parameters are passed to `DockingStation.new`
- [x] Create a unit test for this default capacity
- [x] Use a default argument value within the `initialize` method to make this test pass.

DONE#

18. Dealing with broken bikes

- [ ] Complete the Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle for each of the features above.

As a member of the public,
So that I reduce the chance of getting a broken bike in future,
I'd like to report a bike as broken when I return it.

Public
Bike - is broken
Docking_station - report broken bike

ANSWERED - implemented this user story

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations not to release broken bikes.

maintainer
bike not_working
docking station - does not release bike

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations to accept returning bikes (broken or not).
